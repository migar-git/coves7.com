        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At Coves7, we believe finding the right software shouldn't be a frustrating, time-consuming process. Our mission is simple: provide honest, in-depth reviews and comparisons of business software to help you make informed decisions that drive success.</p>
        
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>We're a team of tech enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and business professionals who have collectively tested hundreds of software tools over the past decade. From AI assistants to project management platforms, trading bots to automation workflows, we've seen what works—and what doesn't.</p>
        
        <p>Founded in 2025, Coves7 was born from a frustration with generic, affiliate-driven "reviews" that prioritize commissions over truth. We set out to build a resource that cuts through marketing hype with real data, real testing, and real opinions.</p>
        
        <h2>How We Review</h2>
        <p>Every tool featured on Coves7 goes through a rigorous evaluation process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hands-On Testing:</strong> We use every tool ourselves, often for weeks or months, in real business scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> We analyze thousands of user reviews and community discussions to understand real-world experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Where applicable, we track hard data—speed, uptime, ROI, accuracy, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Feature Analysis:</strong> We break down features against competitors to see who delivers value.</li>
          <li><strong>Pricing Evaluation:</strong> We calculate total cost of ownership, not just sticker price.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No tool gets a free pass. If we find flaws, limitations, or poor value, we say so—even if it means forgoing affiliate revenue.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Focus Areas</h2>
        <p>We specialize in software categories that drive modern business:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI Tools:</strong> ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, and beyond—AI transforming work.</li>
          <li><strong>Trading Platforms:</strong> Crypto bots, stock platforms, algorithmic trading tools.</li>
          <li><strong>SaaS Tools:</strong> Project management, CRM, productivity suites for teams.</li>
          <li><strong>Automation Software:</strong> Zapier, Make, n8n—tools to streamline repetitive tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why Trust Us?</h2>
        <p>Transparency is our core value. We disclose all affiliate relationships (see our <a href="affiliate-disclosure.html">Affiliate Disclosure</a>) and never let them influence our recommendations. Our team invests hundreds of hours into each major review, often spending our own money to test tools thoroughly.</p>
        <p>We also listen. Reader feedback shapes our content. If you disagree with a review or have a tool you want us to cover, <a href="mailto:hello@coves7.com">tell us</a>.</p>
