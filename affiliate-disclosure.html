        <p>At Coves7, our mission is to provide you with honest, in-depth reviews and comparisons of software tools to help you make informed decisions. To support our work and keep our content free for readers, we participate in affiliate programs.</p>
        
        <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
        <p>Some of the links on our website are "affiliate links." This means that if you click on the link and purchase a product or service, we may receive a small commission from the vendor at no additional cost to you. These commissions help cover the costs of running Coves7, including research, testing, hosting, and content creation.</p>
        
        <h2>Our Commitment to Honesty</h2>
        <p>Our reviews and recommendations are based on extensive testing, research, and real-world usage. We do not let affiliate partnerships influence our opinions or ratings. If we recommend a tool, it's because we genuinely believe in its value based on our evaluation criteria. We clearly disclose when a page or article contains affiliate links.</p>
        
        <h2>Products We Recommend</h2>
        <p>We only partner with companies and products that align with our mission to help you find the best software solutions. Every product or service mentioned on Coves7 has been thoroughly tested by our team or vetted through trusted user feedback and data.</p>
        
        <h2>Your Support Matters</h2>
        <p>By using our affiliate links, you directly support our ability to produce high-quality, unbiased content. We appreciate your trust and are committed to maintaining transparency in everything we do.</p>
        
        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about our affiliate relationships or how we review products, please don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@coves7.com">hello@coves7.com</a>.</p>
